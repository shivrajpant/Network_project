\section{Introduction}
BitCoin was developed in 2008 and 2009 as a radical new concept for money and currency~\cite{nakamoto2008bitcoin} using blockchain technology.
Our research focuses on study data from a BITCOIN marketplace with interactions and ratings~\cite{aw2018analyzing}.
They are (directed) weighted signed network (WSN) in which edge corresponds to some weight, the rating from user u to user v~\cite{moindrot2017trust}.
They forms webs of trust between users allowing two unknown users to perform a transaction based on the aggregated trust~\cite{moindrot2017trust}.

\section{Methodology}
Our paper is to study and analyze the two trust networks: Bitcoin OTC web of trust network and Bitcoin Alpha web of trust network. Moveover, we will predict edge weights from time stamp data in the data sets.
For the experiment, we will extract both topological and non-topological features from the networks~\cite{liben2007link}~\cite{al2006link}~\cite{davis2011multi}.
\section{Data}
We will use two data sets, soc-sign-bitcoin-otc and soc-sign-bitcoin-alpha, from~\cite{snapnets}.
OTC and Alpha are two Bitcoin exchanges, which are open market websites allowing users to buy and sell things~\cite{snapnets}.
The soc-sign-bitcoin-otc, Bitcoin OTC web of trust network, is a (directed) weighted signed network (WSN) with 5,881 nodes and 35,592 edges.
On Bitcoin OTC, people can build up trust to exchange bitcoins with ratings from -10 (total distrust) to 10 (total trust) which are associated with how much a user trusts another user~\cite{moindrot2017trust}. A high rating is mapping the high trust. The data set has the rating times recorded as seconds since Epoch~\cite{snapnets}.

And the soc-sign-bitcoin-alpha, Bitcoin Alpha web of trust network, is also a directed WSN with 3,783 nodes and 24,186 edges.
It is similar in almost every way to the soc-sign-bitcoin-otc. It also has ratings from -10 to 10 and the rating times. While the OTC network
is still active, the Alpha exchange is no longer active now~\cite{moindrot2017trust}.

We will also download ETC-R20 with 3000 lines data.

\section{Related work}
\subsection{Blockchain}
Blockchain is a distributed database to keep records.
A block encrypts the data using cryptographic hash function, such as SHA-256, and keeps record of next available block for traversing the blocks.
Records are stored in a tree structure where the leaves stores the transaction information and other intermediate nodes store the hash values. The root of this tree belongs in a block containing the hash value generated from child nodes.
The timestamp in a block is used to synchronize the position of a block in blockchain.
A block also contains NONCE value, which is random unique number for a specific block.

\subsection{IOTA Network}
IOTA (the Internet of Things Applications) network is an alternate of Bitcoin and it used tangle technology as a distributed ledger instead of Blockchain.
Fig.~\ref{fig:tangle} shows the structure of the tangle network. The network is
a directed acyclic graph where each node indicates an entity that issue and
validate transaction~\cite{popov2016tangle}. The edge indicates the relationship
between a new transaction and the old transaction. The direction of an edge is
from a new transaction to one of the recent transactions. In order to approve a
new transaction, tangle verify most recent two transactions, hence, each node
points to at most two previous nodes in terms of time.

The nodes are growing from left to right accoring to the grow of time.

}
\label{fig:tangle}
\end{figure}

Each node contains information of two weights , one is its own weight (right--botton corner)
and the another one is the cumulative weight (at center). The cumulative
weight of a node is the summation of all the node weights along the path that ends at
that node. According to Fig.~\ref{fig:tangle}, the nodes of all the paths those ended at node $F$ are
A,B,C and E. The cumulative weight of $F$ is
$\sum_{s\in\{A,B,C,D,F\}}{\omega(s)} = 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 3=9$. The weight feature
prevent tangle from a quantum computer attack~\cite{popov2016tangle}.
