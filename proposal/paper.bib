   dependence (often non-computable) defined by Pogdurski and Clarke. In that
   sense, identifies three special effects: entry-dependence (stmts in callee
   depend on predicate on which call-site depends), multiple-context (the
   number of times the dependee is called depends on a predicate), and return-
   dependence (due to halts and exceptions in callees).
   Defines two approaches to interproc ctrl dep computation. The first
   consists on inlined graphs (IIFGs), which can be infinite if there is
   recursion, and hence impractical. Each node in an IIFG corresponding to a
   same stmt represents a unique context. A node n1 is control dependent on
   another node n2 only if the calling context is control dependent on a call
   site that is itself con.
   The second approach is context-independent, called statement-dependent.
   It is more imprecise, but efficient. Dependence among only two IIFG nodes
   (contextual stmts) is enough to deem the stmts a dependent.
   In the end, there is a choice of how many times to unroll (inline)
   procedures to increase dependence precision while controlling cost.

 comment = {General data-flow framework is formally defined; harder to parse, but good to study.
            Data-flow lattice is refined with predicates, in particular, a symbolic execution lattice.
            Uses ``standard techniques'' [17](Abs. from proofs POPL 04) to find new predicates.
            If verification/refutation fails, it determines whether the imprecision is due to
            (1) having followed an infeasible path (finding new predicates that enrich PC and make it infeasible)
            or (2) a join produces a result leading to imprecision, for which predicates are separated.
            Too complex to parse: needs careful analysis to figure out how symbolic expressions are joined.
            (Hypothesis to check: at the end of 4.1, it seems that the order e1 <= e2 btw two abs lattice elems,
             requires that, for all predicates p, the set s1 of concrete states that sat p in e1 is
             a subset of s2 for e2. Given this, the join is just the union of the corresponding sets.)
