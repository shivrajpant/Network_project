\subsection{Paper \cite{aw2018analyzing}}

The authors have suggested some possible future research directions such as 1) Developing mechanisms to capture preferential attachment by
including probability of an edge with a node based on node ratings on the synthetic models. 2)Modelling temporal aspect to reï¬‚ect growth of network with time, and separately modeling in-degree and out-degree to reflect only nodes with positive rating able to rate other nodes.

Other promising line of research might be to leverage the capability of synthetic network models to fraud detection in social networks where nodes(users) may dishonestly provide wrong rating values for other nodes. This kind of analysis is particularly helpful in ecommerce and other areas where user ratings are extremely important. Furthermore, the synthetic model can be extended to make it robust.

\subsection{Paper \cite{kumar2016edge}}
The study has analyzed and applied the solution for social networks. Future research may involve leaveraging the current solution to analyze and predict behaviours of other types of networks.
